    <br>
    Grocery Gopher opens to your shopping list.&nbsp; Groceries are
    listed in order, by department.&nbsp; You can customize which
    departments appear before or after other departments in the settings
    menu to better match the department layout of your particular store.<br>
    <br>
    Groceries added to your shopping list from the pantry are removed
    from your shopping list by swiping each item to the right.&nbsp;
    Swiping the item to the right will update that item's average pantry
    shelf life.&nbsp; Swiping an item left will also remove an item from
    your shopping list however, shelf life will not be updated.&nbsp;
    Shelf life is indicated by colored dots:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/r-dot.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> The red dot
    next to the "Bread" item in the example view suggests that you are
    completely out of bread in your pantry.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/y-dot.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> A yellow dot
    such as that next to "Milk" in the example would indicate that you
    have a two to three day supply of milk remaining in your pantry.<br>
    <br>
    Included in this view are two buttons:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/b-x.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> The "x" button
    switches you from your shopping list to your pantry view and
    vice-versa.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/b-equals.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Pressing the
    "=" button will save a copy of your entire grocery list to the cloud
    allowing your list to be shared across devices.&nbsp; For example,
    one person can make out a shopping list and save it to the cloud by
    pressing the "=" button while another person at the store can
    retrieve the shopping list simply by pressing the "=" button on
    their phone.&nbsp; The grocery lists will be synchronized.&nbsp;
    Sharing is accomplished through use of Google Drive and because of
    drive limitations, the "=" button will be disabled for one (1)
    minute after synchronization.&nbsp; In addition, there is the
    possibility of data loss if more then one device attempts
    synchronization at exactly the same time. <br>
