    <img src="image/b-plus.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Pressing the
    "+" button while in the pantry view allows you to add a new grocery
    item to your pantry by opening the add grocery dialog.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/add-name.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Every
    grocery in your pantry must have its own individual name; duplicate
    names are not permitted. Item names should contain only uppercase or
    lowercase letters, numbers and spaces. Other characters are reserved
    for special use such as the dash "-" character.&nbsp; Special use
    characters are enabled via the settings menu.&nbsp; When the dash
    character is used as part of the grocery item's name, then any text
    appearing after the dash will be displayed instead of the
    department; items on your shopping list will still be sorted by
    department but, the department name will be hidden.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/add-dept.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Select the
    department where the new grocery item is located from the department
    drop down menu.&nbsp; Grocery Gopher comes preloaded with a list of
    departments typically found in most grocery stores and additional
    departments may be added through the settings menu.&nbsp; Item's
    appear on your shopping list ordered by department, the order of
    which also may be adjusted through the settings menu.&nbsp; A useful
    tip is to add other stores as individual departments to the bottom
    of the department list. If for example you do most of your grocery
    shopping at Kroger but, purchase just a few items at Walmart, then
    add Walmart as a department to the bottom of the list.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/add-check.png" alt="" align="absmiddle">Checking the
    "Also include on shopping list" checkbox will include this new item
    on your shopping list in addition to adding the item to your pantry
    once you press the "Save" button.<br>
