    <img src="image/b-x.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Pressing the "x"
    button switched you from your shopping list to your pantry
    view.&nbsp; All your groceries are listed in alphabetical order with
    groceries already included on your shopping list shown as
    grayed.&nbsp; To add or remove an item from your shopping list,
    simply swipe the item right.&nbsp; If the item is already on your
    shopping list, the item will be returned to the pantry without any
    update to average shelf life.&nbsp; Just as in your shopping list,
    an item's shelf life is indicated by colored dots, in addition to
    red and yellow dots:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/g-dot.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> The green dots
    next to the "Apples"&nbsp; and "Peanut Butter" items in the example
    view above suggests that these items are currently on hand at home.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/gy-dot.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> A gray dot
    means that the item is included on your shopping list or that the
    item has not been purchased enough times (two) to determine an
    average shelf life.<br>
    <br>
    Included in this view are three buttons and two submenu buttons:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/b-x.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> The "x" button
    returns you to your Shopping List view.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/b-plus.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> The "+" button
    opens the Add Grocery view allowing you to add new groceries to your
    grocery list.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/b-less.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Touching the
    "&lt;" button slides open the Settings view.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/b-edit.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Pressing the
    "Edit" button in the pantry view opens that grocery item's editing
    dialog window.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/b-delete.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Pressing the
    "Delete" button in the pantry view opens the grocery delete warning
    asking you to confirm the permanent removal of the grocery item.<br>
