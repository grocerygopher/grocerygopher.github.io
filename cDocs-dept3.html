    the "Manage" button under the "Department" submenu while in the
    Settings view opens the "Department Manager" dialog which allows you
    to sort and delete departments. You may sort and/or delete multiple
    departments before saving.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/dept-delete.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> The
    department delete button acts as a toggle switch: <br>
    <ul>
      <li><strike>Organic/Natural</strike>.&nbsp; It will strike-through
        an active department name queuing it for deletion, or</li>
      <li>Organic/Natural.&nbsp; It will remove the strike-through and
        not delete a department queued for deletion.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="image/b-save.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> The "Save"
    button saves all changes made to the department manager list as to
    sorting and deleting, then returns you to the Settings menu.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/b-cancel.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Pressing the
    "Cancel" button returns you to the Settings menu without applying
    any changes.
