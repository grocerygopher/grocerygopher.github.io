    <img src="image/b-add-depts.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Pressing
    the "Add" button under the "Department" submenu while in the
    Settings view opens the "Add a New Department" dialog.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/dept-name.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Every
    department must have its own individual name; duplicate names are
    not permitted.&nbsp; Names should contain only uppercase or
    lowercase letters, numbers and spaces.&nbsp; You do not have to
    limit yourself to names of departments found within your store; you
    may want to consider adding a store name to the department list
    instead.&nbsp; If for example you do most of your grocery shopping
    at Kroger but, purchase just a few items at Whole Foods, then add
    Whole Foods as a department for the few items you purchase at that
    store while keeping the regular department names for the items you
    purchase at Kroger.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/b-save.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> The "Save"
    button stores the new department at the bottom of the ordered
    department list, then returns you to the Settings menu.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/b-cancel.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Pressing the
    "Cancel" button returns you to the Settings menu without applying
    any changes.
