    &nbsp;Under the "General Settings" subheading, your options include:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Hiding groceries with a current shelf life greater than 30
        days from displaying in the pantry view. Groceries will not
        appear on the pantry list until the item is within 30 days of
        purchase.</li>
      <li>Enabling special formatting characters in grocery item
        names.&nbsp; Currently only the dash, "-" is a recognized
        special character.&nbsp; When the dash is used as a special
        character, the department name is hidden and replaced by the
        text after the dash in the grocery item name.&nbsp; This is
        useful if you want to include a specific brand in the name such
        as: "Coffee - Folgers" in "Dry Goods" would appear as "Coffee"
        with "Folgers" underneath where the department name is usually
        listed; the "Dry Goods" department would be hidden from
        view.&nbsp; However, the item would still appear with other
        items in "Dry Goods" on your shopping list; this feature does
        not replace the department.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Locking Grocery Gopher into portrait mode only.&nbsp; This
        does not effect any other app on your phone, it locks only the
        Grocery Gopher app.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
