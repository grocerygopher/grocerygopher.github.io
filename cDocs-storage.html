    External storage is provided as a means for you to save a backup
    copy of all your Grocery Gopher app settings and data.&nbsp; On
    older devices, this was usually a removable SD memory card however,
    on newer devices it may be any area set aside by your device for
    external storage and it may not be removable. In the unlikely event
    of phone data loss or cloud data corruption, external storage
    provides a fail safe method of protecting your data:<br>

    enabled, External Storage is disabled by toggling the switch to the
    "Off" position. <br>

    <img src="image/storage-save.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> You must
    press the "Save" button to save a current copy of your data; there
    is no automatic schedule.&nbsp; If data already exists in external
    storage, then you will be prompted to confirm that you want to
    overwrite the data with the current data.<br>
