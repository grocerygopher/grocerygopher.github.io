    Once a connection with Google Drive is established, you will be
    prompted to continue with cloud data storage setup:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/b-continue.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Touching
    the "Continue" button will save your grocery list as
    "grocerygopher.db"&nbsp; to cloud storage in either one of two
    methods:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>If "grocerygopher.db" doesn't exist in the cloud, then the
        file will be created from your current grocery list and the
        Sharing and Synchronizing dialog will open.&nbsp; This typically
        will be done the first time you setup Google Drive storage.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If there already exists a "grocerygopher.db" file, then the
        Uploading/Downloading dialog will open asking you to choose
        whether to copy the cloud file to your device or to upload and
        replace the cloud file with your grocery list.&nbsp; This
        usually happens when you are sharing your grocery list with a
        new device and would typically choose to download the cloud
        file.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

    "Cancel" button disables use of Google Drive and returns you to the
    Settings menu.<br>
