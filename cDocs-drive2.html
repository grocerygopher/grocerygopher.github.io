    Once a connection with Google Drive is established, you will be
    prompted to continue with cloud data storage setup:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/b-continue.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Touching
    the "Continue" button will save your grocery list as
    "grocerygopher.db"&nbsp; to cloud storage in either one of two
    methods:<br>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>If "grocerygopher.db" doesn't exist in the cloud, then the
        file will be created from your current grocery list and the
        Sharing and Synchronizing dialog will open.&nbsp; This typically
        will be done the first time you setup Google Drive storage, or<br>
      </li>
      <li>If there already exists a "grocerygopher.db" file, then the
        Google Drive Sync dialog will open allowing you to choose
        whether to download the cloud file or upload the grocery list
        already on your device.&nbsp; This usually occurs when you are
        setting up sharing on a new device.</li>
    </ol>
    <img src="image/b-cancel.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Pressing the
    "Cancel" button disables use of Google Drive and returns you to the
    Settings menu.
