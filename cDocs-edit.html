    A grocery item's "Edit" submenu button is accessed in the pantry
    view by sliding the grocery item name to the left.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/b-edit.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Pressing the
    "Edit" button in the pantry view opens that grocery item's editing
    dialog window:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/add-name.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> The item
    "Item Name" box provides you with a convenient way to correct any
    spelling errors or add a special character such as the dash "-".<br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/add-dept.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Similarly,
    the "Department" box allows you to change an item's location in the
    store, or if you have added a separate store to your department list
    then you could also change the item's store in its entirety. <br>
    <br>
    <img src="image/edit-life.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> "Shelf
    Life" determines how many days a grocery item lasts before it must
    be purchased again and is reflected by the item's dot color.&nbsp;
    The elapsed days before a repurchase may be adjusted using the
    "&lt;&lt;" or "&lt;" buttons to decrease shelf life by increments of
    30 days or 1 day respectfully. Similarly shelf life may be increased
    by touching the "&gt;" or "&gt;&gt;" buttons.&nbsp; The sensitivity
    bar reflects to what degree purchases should effect adjustments to
    shelf life: the higher the sensitivity, the more often a purchase
    will change shelf life.&nbsp; For example: if you have an item you
    only purchase once a month then, set the shelf life to 30 days and
    slide the sensitivity bar all the way to the left. In this way if
    you repurchase the item in advance due to a sale or special, the
    item's shelf life will not be changed to any degree.<br>
