    <br>
    Once your device is synchronized with cloud storage you will be
    asked how often auto synchronization should be scheduled.&nbsp; The
    default action is "Never" meaning that no auto synchronization will
    occur and that you will manually synchronize your data by pressing
    the <img src="image/b-equals.png" alt="" align="absmiddle">button
    on your shopping list when needed.<br>
    <br>
    The last information needed to complete setting up cloud storage
    with Google Drive is setting which grocery list has the priority in
    the event of any conflicts in data.&nbsp; Choose:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>"Not Shared" if this is the only device you are using and
        cloud storage is primarily used as a backup.</li>
      <li>"Primary and Shared" if the grocery list on this device is the
        primary list which is shared <i><b>TO</b></i> other devices. In
        setting up additional devices the "Secondary and Shared" option
        should be selected.<br>
      </li>
      <li>"Secondary and Shared" if the grocery list on this device is
        shared <i><b>FROM</b></i> another primary device.&nbsp; One
        other device should be designated as "Primary and Shared" to use
        this option. </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="image/b-done.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> The "Done"
    button completes cloud storage setup, saves your choices and returns
    you to the Settings menu.<br>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <img src="image/b-cancel.png" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Pressing the
    "Cancel" button disables use of Google Drive and returns you to the
    Settings menu.
